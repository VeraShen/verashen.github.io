###  RULES OF THE ROAD FOR GROWING YOUR FOLLOWERS  ### 
<h6>What you need to know in order to make sure you are following Twitter’s guidelines so you can keep following everyday</h6>
<hr>


When looking to grow your Twitter audience there are a few things to remember in order to do it the right way and not run into any issues.  Refollow allows you to carefully select your audience and build that audience very quickly.  Because your followers will be growing rapidly, it’s important to make sure you are aware of Twitter’s guidelines.

Firstly, remember the number 2000.  Twitter limits the the number of people you can follow to 2000 UNTIL you have 2000 or more followers.  When you are just starting out building your audience it’s important to pick people with a high probability of following you back so that you can have a high follow back rate.  That will make sure you're following and followers are closely aligned and not lopsided (although, having more followers is ALWAYS a good thing).  

Another option to keep your following in check is to regularly ‘cleanup’ your timeline by unfollowing people who don’t follow you back.  With strategic growth being the main objective, it’s valuable to make sure that all your follows are being reciprocated. Using the filter to unfollow people who haven’t followed you back in a certain number of days will allow you to make sure that you aren’t following a lot of people who won’t follow you back.

Once you’ve reached 2000 followers, the guidelines change.  From that point on you aren’t directly limited to following a certain number of people.  Instead, your follower / following ratio is measured to make sure that you aren’t spamming people.  Simply put, if your follower/following ratio drops below .90, you may be restricted on how many actions you can take in a given day.  

Knowing this we included detailed metrics about each of your Twitter profiles so that you can monitor this ratio.  If get to that .90 number or below it’s always a good idea to unfollow some people who haven’t followed you back in a long time.  By cleaning up your timeline, your f/f ratio will get a boost and you should be able to start building your audience.
