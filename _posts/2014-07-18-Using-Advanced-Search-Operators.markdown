USING ADVANCED SEARCH OPERATORS

Searches on Refollow can be customized to an even greater degree by using advanced search operators.  Search operators not only allow for more customization but can save time because they are basically shorthand for filters.

Simply, create a new campaign within Refollow and from the dropdown select “Tweet the phrase” or “Have words in their profile.”






In the search field next to the dropdown use the table below to customize your campaign:

Operator
Description of results
twitter search
containing both “twitter” and “search”
“happy hour”
containing the exact phrase “happy hour”
beer OR wine
containing either “beer” or wine” (or both)
spongebob -patrick
containing “spongebob” but NOT “patrick”
#haiku
containing the hashtag “haiku”
from:originatelabs
sent from person “originatelabs”
to:techcrunch
sent to person “techcrunch”
“happy hour” near: “san francisco”
containing the exact phrase “happy hour” sent near “san francisco”
near:NYC within:15mi
sent within 15 miles of “NYC”.
superhero since:1986-11-13
containing “superhero” and sent since date “1986-11-13” (year-month-day)
ftw until:1986-11-13
containing “ftw” and sent up to date “1986-11-13”
movie -scary
containing “movie”, but not “scary”, and with a positive attitude.
flight :(
containing “flight” and with a negative attitude.
traffic ?
containing “traffic” and asking a question
hilarious filter:links
containing “hilarious” and linking to URLs.
news source:twitterfeed
containing “news” and entered via TwitterFeed

Some of you may actually have a list of “forbidden” words or phrases that you use on every campaign to be sure that people who use those words or phrases don’t show up in your search results.  To accomodate this need there is a special section below the search field that you can use to further narrow down your results.  NOTE: when entering keywords in the Include and Exclude section, you DO NOT need to use any operators like the “-“ before the keyword.












These excluded words can be applied to different fields (listed in the dropdown above) so that you can specificy exactly where these excluded or included words should be filtered.
