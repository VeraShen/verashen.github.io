###  USING ADVANCED SEARCH OPERATORS  ### 
<h6>Getting the most of the search bar when creating a campaign by using advanced search operators</h6>
<hr>


**S**earches on Refollow can be customized to an even greater degree by using advanced search operators.  Search operators not only allow for more customization but can save time because they are basically shorthand for filters.


Simply, create a new campaign within Refollow and from the dropdown select “Tweet the phrase” or “Have words in their profile.”


![Search Operators](/img/post/Search-Operators.png)


In the search field next to the dropdown use the table below to customize your campaign:


<table class="operators">
    <tr>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>Description of results</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>twitter search</td>
        <td>containing both “twitter” and “search”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>containing the exact phrase “happy hour”</td>
    </tr>

Some of you may actually have a list of “forbidden” words or phrases that you use on every campaign to be sure that people who use those words or phrases don’t show up in your search results.  To accomodate this need there is a special section below the search field that you can use to further narrow down your results.  NOTE: when entering keywords in the Include and Exclude section, you DO NOT need to use any operators like the “-“ before the keyword.

![Exclusion Words](/img/post/Exclusion-Words.png)

These excluded words can be applied to different fields (listed in the dropdown above) so that you can specificy exactly where these excluded or included words should be filtered.
